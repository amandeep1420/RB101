  - write a program that reads in some text from a text file you have created 
    and then plugs in a selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and 
    advers into that text and prints it. replacement list can be built directly
    into program, but text should come from external source.
    my program should read the text and place random words of the appropriate
    types into the text for each line, printing the result.
