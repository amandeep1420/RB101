# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(2, todo, done)

p todo # should be: ['coffee with Tom']
p done # should be: ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']

# not using n, recursion not needed
# book added a break condition for the recursion
# n was only used to track the recusion levels, was never used for shift
